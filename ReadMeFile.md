## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for my first bootcamp project.

The game was developed based on the 90's TV hit Twin Peaks created by David Lynch and Mark Frost.

## Design  

In shaping the game's design, I drew from a retro pixel art aesthetic. I meticulously crafted all game characters, in the charming pixelated style. The backgrounds, sourced online, were also pixelated for visual coherence.  

Additionally, I created responsive, retro-styled buttons from scratch, providing intuitive hover and click interactions. This design combines the charm of retro pixel art with modern usability, enhancing the overall player experience.

## MVP

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements of the project, to be achieved within a week were as follow:

- Render a game in a browser.

- Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player.

- Game must have logic that allows the player to win or lose.

- Game code must be organized in separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

- Game entities and elements must be organized using classes and OOP.

- Have a repo on GitHub.

- Have at least one (1) commit per day that you worked on.

- Game deployed online using GitHub Pages so anyone can play it.

- Code should follow the principles of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).
